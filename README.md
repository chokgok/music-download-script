Download and install [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

# Installation and Execution

## Linux/MacOS

Download the script `cmd.sh` into your music directory and run it using your favourite terminal emulator.
Use `-h` or `--help` for help using the script.

## Windows

Download the script `cmd_win.sh` into your music directory and run it with one of the following:

- Git Bash (comes with installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on Windows)
- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL)

Use `-h` or `--help` for help using the script.

A native batch script is on the backburner while I figure out Spotify.

## Android

If you are using an Android phone, I recommend using Termux as a terminal emulator.

You can get Termux [here on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or [here on GitHub](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.1).

After that, follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/cyrillkuettel/d63785cf5f4c00106ae215188c377515) for getting Termux all set up and `yt-dlp` installed.

Using the script is the same process on [Linux/MacOS](#linux-macos).
